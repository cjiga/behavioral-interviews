<summary><b> 3.- Can you describe a time when you had to deal with a team member who wasn't pulling their weight?</b></summary>
So I actually faced this kind of situation in one of my previous roles. And I can give you my experience. 
So we were working on a project and, we realized that on of other developer, they were not filfilling their commitments towards
the task that they were being assigned to and then that was causing a stain on the existing projec. So that developer was reasonably good
like there were no issues with him, but suddenly he started doing that. OS I reached out to him. I asked him, hey what is the issue? 
Is that something wrong that is going on? Why you are not able to do that? I asked that in a personal meeting and I realized that one of 
very close family members of that particular coworker was actually really sick and was in a very critical condition in the hospital. So that 
coworker was pretty stressed about that situation of that family memeber, maybe, like fighting for the life and death in the hospital and that 
was causing him all sorts of anxiety issues because that family member staying in the hospital the overall responsibilities were way too much

<summary><b> 4.- How do you handle a situation where you disagree with a supervisor?</b></summary>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Situation: </b> In my previous role as a technical lead, we were developing a new feature for our primary application. My supervisor wanted to implement a particular approach to the feature that I felt was not optimal for the long-term maintainability and scalability of the system.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Task: </b> As the technical lead, it was my responsibility to ensure that the solutions we implemented were not only effective in the short term but also sustainable and efficient in the long run. I needed to address my concerns with my supervisor and propose a better solution without causing any conflict or delay in the project timeline.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Action: </b> I first gathered data and examples to support my perspective, including potential issues with the proposed approach and benefits of my suggested solution. I then scheduled a meeting with my supervisor to discuss my concerns. During the meeting, I respectfully outlined my points and presented my evidence. I emphasized the importance of maintainability and scalability, and how my approach would better serve those goals. I also showed that I understood the supervisorâ€™s perspective and was open to finding a compromise.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Result: </b> My supervisor appreciated my preparation and the professional way I presented my case. We were able to have an open and constructive discussion. Ultimately, we agreed on a modified approach that incorporated elements from both of our ideas. This resulted in a more robust and maintainable solution that satisfied both immediate project needs and long-term objectives. This experience strengthened my relationship with my supervisor and demonstrated the value of open communication and collaboration in resolving disagreements.
